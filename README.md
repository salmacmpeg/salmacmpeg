# Salma AbdelMonem | ðŸ§ª Applied ML Researcher

Lecturer Assistant | Cairo, Egypt | Transitioning from Academia to Production ML & LLM Engineering.

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Salma, an applied machine learning researcher and PhD (scheduled) in machine learning, and I'm on a hands-on journey exploring my passion for building ML systems.

## ðŸ”§ What Iâ€™ve Recently Learned & Built

Iâ€™ve been sharpening my engineering toolkit for reliable, maintainable ML apps:

- **Code quality & automation**: Linting (`flake8`), logging (`loguru`), testing (`pytest`), clean architecture, dependency management using (`poetry`),  automation with (`Makefiles`), and  CI/CD using (`GitHub Actions`). 
- **NLP with Python and HuggingFace**: Feature engineering, (`KNN`), (`HuggingFace`) models, cosine similarity, and  (`Gradio`) UI.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: With (`LangChain`), (`Chroma vectorstore`), and (`Ollama`).
- **MLflow for customer churn prediction**: Experiment data and model tracking, parameters, metrics, and automated model deployment with (`MLflow`).
- **Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning**: Text classification using traditional machine learning, CNNs, RNNs, and transformers, with modular training and evaluation pipelines.

# Here is a summary of my latest projects
These projects demonstrate end-to-end machine learning applications that prioritize modularity, scalability, and real-world impact. As I transition into MLOps and LLM Engineering, these projects highlight my expertise in building production-ready systems.
