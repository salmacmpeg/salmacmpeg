# Salma AbdelMonem | ðŸ§ª Applied ML Researcher

Lecturer Assistant | Cairo, Egypt | Transitioning into Production ML & LLM Engineering.

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Salma, an applied machine learning researcher with a strong academic foundation, and I'm on a hands-on journey exploring my passion for building ML systems.

## ðŸ”§ What Iâ€™ve Recently Learned & Built

Iâ€™ve been sharpening my engineering toolkit for reliable, maintainable ML apps:

- **Code quality & automation**: Linting (`flake8`), logging (`loguru`), testing (`pytest`), clean architecture, dependency management using (`poetry`),  automation with (`Makefiles`), and  CI/CD using (`GitHub Actions`). 
- **NLP with Python and HuggingFace** Feature engineering, (`KNN`), (`HuggingFace`) models, cosine similarity, and  (`Gradio`) UI.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** with (`LangChain`), (`Chroma vectorstore`), and (`Ollama`).
- **MLflow for customer churn prediction data and model tracking and versioning** experiment tracking, model registry, and automated deployment with (`MLflow`).

# Here is a summary of my latest projects
These projects demonstrate end-to-end machine learning applications that prioritize modularity, scalability, and real-world impact. As I transition into MLOps and LLM Engineering, these projects highlight my expertise in building production-ready systems.

## ðŸš€ What Iâ€™m Currently Working Toward

Iâ€™m actively building my next wave of skills through focused self-learning and personal projects:

-  **PyTorch** â€“ mastering custom model development.
-  **LangChain** â€“ chaining agents/tools and building private LLM workflows.
-  **AWS & SageMaker** â€“ deploying scalable ML models in the cloud.
-  **FastAPI** â€“ building clean, scalable APIs for ML inference.

## ðŸŽ¯ My Technical Interests

- Designing insightful modular ML apps.
- NLP, document parsing, and automated knowledge extraction using OCR + regex.
- Bridging the gap between ML research and deployable, maintainable engineering workflows.
- Mentoring students and peers, building intuitive pipelines, and making technical knowledge accessible.
