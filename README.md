# Salma AbdelMonem | Applied ML Researcher

Lecturer Assistant | Cairo, Egypt | Transitioning into Production ML & LLM Engineering

## Hi there 👋

I’m Salma, an applied machine learning researcher with a strong academic foundation, and I'm on a hands-on journey exploring my passion for building ML systems.

## What I’ve Recently Learned & Built

I’ve been sharpening my engineering toolkit for reliable, maintainable ML apps:

- **Code quality & automation**: Linting (`flake8`), logging (`loguru`), testing (`pytest`), clean architecture, CI/CD with GitHub Actions, and automation with Makefiles
- **NLP with Python and HuggingFace** Feature engineering, (`KNN`), (`HuggingFace`) models, cosine similarity, and  (`Gradio`) UI
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** with (`LangChain`), (`Chroma vector store`), and (`Ollama`).

# Here is a summary of my latest projects
These projects demonstrate end-to-end machine learning applications that prioritize modularity, scalability, and real-world impact. As I transition into MLOps and LLM Engineering, these projects highlight my expertise in building production-ready systems.

## PersonalityPrediction  (https://github.com/salmacmpeg/PersonalityPrediction)
Personality classification tool with full CI/CD automation and clean architecture.

**Highlights:**
- Decision Tree pipeline built with Poetry + Makefile
- Automated testing and linting with GitHub Actions
- Loguru logging and modular config files
- Pytest coverage across training/inference workflows

## Movies_recommendation_app (https://github.com/salmacmpeg/Movies_recommendation_app)  
Hybrid movie recommender using metadata + semantic similarity in Gradio.

**Highlights:**
- KNN over count-vectorized genres + vote stats
- Transformer-based embeddings via Hugging Face
- Cached inference for fast performance
- Scrollable UI with dynamic filtering

---
## QuizGenerator (https://github.com/salmacmpeg/QuizGenerator)
RAG-based app for generating contextual quiz questions from course materials.

**Highlights:**
- Embedding with `sentence-transformers`, generation via LLaMA 3.2
- Modular LangChain pipeline: loading, indexing, querying
- Gradio UI for interactive quiz generation
- Local deployment using Ollama for privacy

## What I’m Currently Working Toward

I’m actively building my next wave of skills through focused self-learning and personal projects:

-  **PyTorch** – mastering custom model development
-  **LangChain** – chaining agents/tools and building private LLM workflows
-  **AWS & SageMaker** – deploying scalable ML models in the cloud
-  **MLflow** – experiment tracking, model registry, and automated deployment
-  **FastAPI** – building clean, scalable APIs for ML inference

Each new skill gets applied and tested in real projects—because learning sticks best when it’s built into something you’re proud to use and share.

## My Technical Interests

- Designing modular ML apps with a strong focus on UX, observability, and reproducibility
- NLP, document parsing, and automated knowledge extraction using OCR + regex
- Bridging the gap between ML research and deployable, maintainable engineering workflows
- Mentoring students and peers, building intuitive pipelines, and making technical knowledge accessible
